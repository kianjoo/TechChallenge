# The Flight Plan project
Problem statement: Flights file a flight plan that specify a route that the pilot wishes to take between its departure and destination airports. The route is made up of waypoints and airways. We want to create a software that interrogates a few APIs, select a flight and display the associated flight route on a global map.

An additional task would be to find and propose alternate flight routes when a button is pressed and to display it accordingly. This additional task is an optional task and candidates need not complete this task.
